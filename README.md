=================

This is my online portfolio, living at http://james.da.ydrea.ms.

So it can degrade gracefully, I'm building for older browsers first and adding newer stuff later. You'll see this reflected in the commits.

Right now, there's a separate repo for */historicalvotes*, though it lives at this domain. I haven't yet decided the best way to maintain these. There's a good chance */historicalvotes* will get folded into this repo.

See the [changelog][1] here.

            <p>I'm a tinkerer who loves the creative freedom technology enables. I like my hands dirty.</p>

            <p>For 14 years, I've built and managed digital content in a career path that began as a newsroom apprentice at the <a href="http://www.freep.com" target="_new">Detroit Free Press</a> and traced the stark border between journalism and technology.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesthomaswebguy" target="_new">My LinkedIn profile</a> and <a href="pdf/jamesthomas_resume042614.pdf">resume</a> give a glimpse of this odd, interesting space: ("Here, edit this election story. ... Now turn this Illustrator file into code. ... Now parse this XML feed.")</p>
            <p>I've increasingly spent more time on the tech side, and I'd like to focus my career on it.</p>
            <p>I've got a solid understanding of Web standards and the core principles of object-oriented programming. Lately I've been learning some compiled languages and practicing mobile development.</p>
            <p>But I started as a writer and still love the written word. I strive for a well-turned phrase, and news that's accurate, engaging and incisive. Much of my Freep.com work has been making concise Web text read well.</p>
            <p>My career has mostly been in large news organizations, working on tight deadlines in a collaborative environment. I've cherished having great co-workers. It's a trend I know will continue.</p>

    <h1 class="nameplate">James Thomas</h1>
    <p class="body-copy">For two decades -- my entire professional life -- I've worked for large news organizations as a digital editor, producer and developer. Since 2012, I've been a software engineer for the Interactive News department of The New York Times. Before that, I spent 11 years as Web Editor for the Detroit Free Press.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Most of what I do is collaborative and behind the scenes, like the code wired into the nytimes.com home page on presidential debate nights that allows editors to curate up-to-the-minute photos and video in its centerpiece. Nights like these, I'm shoulder-to-shoulder with those editors in the nerve center of the newsroom to guard against unforeseen bugs, errant captions and 404s.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">But I work far more often outside the breaking news cycle. An example is the interactive template I built for The Real Estate section's weekly column <em>The Hunt</em>, where readers can get an intimate understanding of New York's bonkers housing market by playing a quiz game weaved into the narrative. Gamifying the column has helped Real Estate find more habitual readers.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Part of my job is training the newsroom to use the apps and templates we build in Interactive News. I write code, documentation and curricula, and I help editors incubate new ways to use the tools we provide. The idea to gamify the <em>The Hunt</em> grew out of one of these training sessions.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Occasionally, I'm able to write, illustrate or design a self-contained story. I'm most proud of a piece I designed myself, a visually rich portrait of New York's street dance culture.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">Scenes like these fall within a huge blind spot shared by large media organizations and represent missed opportunities to earn trust and engagement from audiences that don't typically see themselves reflected with much fidelity.</p> 
    <p class="body-copy">I'm compelled to use my mix of skills and perspective to narrow this blind spot and I'm looking for more opportunities to guide a story from reporting through presentation.</p>
    <p class="body-copy">It's work that strikes a sweet spot for me: solving logical puzzles that result in increased understading of the world. crafting words and visuals</p>

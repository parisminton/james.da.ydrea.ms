            <h2>People seem to dig my expressive ability.</h2>
            <p>It's all been fun... the journalism, the programming, the graphic design. But it's also been meaningful.</p>
            <p>My goal is to keep that balance of meaningful, challenging and fun work throughout my career.</p>

            <h2>About James</h2>
            <p>I'm a tinkerer who loves the creative freedom technology enables. I like my hands dirty.</p>
            <p>For fourteen years, I've built and managed Web sites in a career that began as a newsroom apprentice at the Detroit Free Press.</p>
            <p>I've got a solid understanding of Web standards and the core principles of object-oriented programming. Lately I've been learning some compiled languages and practicing mobile development.</p>
            <p>But I started as a writer and still love the written word. I strive for a well-turned phrase, and news that's accurate, engaging and incisive. Much of my Freep.com work has been making concise Web text read well.</p>
            <p>My career has mostly been in large news organizations, working on tight deadlines in a collaborative environment. I've cherished having great co-workers.</p>
